                    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
                </div>
<p class="first"><strong>TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS DEFINITIONS</strong></p>
<p>The GT 100 Club are transparent in everything we do, so rather than pages of legal speak terms and conditions, we have set out what we expect from our members and what you can expect from the GT100 Club Limited throughout your time with the club.</p>

<p><strong><u>Memberships</strong></u></p>
<p>By paying an annual membership fee, we promise you access to The GT100 club cars all year round. </p>
<p>All membership fees are paid in full in advance. </p>
<p>There are no joining fees to pay. Your one off annual membership fee includes an agreed amount of points to use on all of our cars. Insurance, breakdown cover and all running costs are included in your membership fee.</p>
<p>The membership start date will be the date of signature on this agreement and subject to cleared funds being received. </p>
<p>The membership will expire exactly one year after your membership start date. </p>
<p>Once paid, memberships are non-refundable, unless The GT100 Club has agreed to a refund for specific circumstances. </p>

<p><strong><u>Allocation of points</strong></u></p>

<p>In exchange for your annual membership fee, The GT100 Club will allocate an agreed number of points to your Club account. <br />
The level of points are determined by which tier of membership you choose. </p>

<p>Each car uses a different amount of points. You can look at our points table anytime to see the points used for 1 days hire in each car. <br />
We have no weekend or seasonal premiums so if you want a particular car for a 3 day weekend, the amount of points you need will simply be the individual daily rate * 3. </p>

<p>There is a minimum of 1 days hire and maximum of 7 days hire for any individual car. </p>

<p>Whenever you take a car from the Club then the total amount of points will be deducted from your Club account. </p>

<p>Once your allocation of points have all been used, The GT100 Club will give you an option to buy more points at an agreed rate. </p>

<p>During your annual membership, The GT100 Club guarantees they will not increase the level of points for any current cars. </p>

<p>We will always try and keep the points for our cars as low as possible, but sometimes, especially with some of our very rare cars, the running costs are higher than forecasted. In these cases, The GT100 Club reserve the right to increase the points for any of the cars. </p>

<p>However any such increases will only become relevant to your membership on renewal and will not be applied to your current year’s membership. </p>

<p>Points must be used within the 12 month period and any unused club points will expire on the anniversary of your membership. <br />
Any remaining points cannot be carried over on renewal. </p>

<p>Points and memberships are non-transferable, without the prior written consent of The GT100 Club. </p>


 
<p><strong><u>Named drivers</strong></u></p>
<p>The member can assign 1 named driver on membership Tier 2, and 2 named drivers on membership Tier 3. </p>

<p>These named drivers can only drive the car that The Member is in custody of during the agreed hire period and cannot at any time choose an additional vehicle to that of The Member. </p>


<p><strong><u>Insurances and excesses</strong></u></p>
<p>The use of Club Cars by Members is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the Club’s insurance policy. A copy of the Club’s insurance policy may be inspected by Members at the Club Premises. </p>
<p>Our members must be 28 years old or over, have held a full UK license for 3 years or longer and have no more than 6 points on their license. Our members must also have no more than 2 insurance claims during the last 3 years. </p>

<p>The GT100 Club cars may only be driven by Members and their named drivers and only driven on UK roads. The cars are not covered for non UK roads, track days or any race or competitive event. </p>

<p>Insurance cover is for social, domestic and pleasure use only. Cars are not covered for business use. </p>

<p>Details of insurance excesses for each car are detailed within the membership agreement and also available separately on request. </p>

<p>In the event of damage, the excess amount will be claimed in full from the member. <br />
However, In the event the repair is less than the excess level, the member will be refunded the difference. Invoices for all work carried out will be supplied on request. </p>

<p>Members shall be liable to pay the total cost of repair or replacement for all damage or loss suffered by a Club Car as a result of wilful and or unlawful action by the Member. </p>

<p>In the event of any accident, to protect the interest of the Club’s insurance company, the Member agrees to the following: </p>

<p>Make no admission of liability or guilt. </p>

<p>Make every effort to obtain names and addresses of parties involved and of independent witnesses and photograph the scene. </p>

<p>Notify the police immediately if another party’s guilt has been ascertained or if people or animals are injured or if the car is stolen. </p>

<p>Not abandon the vehicle without adequate provision for safeguarding and securing the same. </p>

<p>Notify the Club in case of damage, further providing a detailed report and diagram and photographs to the Club within 24 hours. </p>

<p>In the event of the theft of a Club vehicle, the Member shall inform the Police immediately, obtain crime report number and report the theft and the crime report information to The GT100 Club. </p>


 
<p><strong><u>Damage excesses</strong></u></p>
<p>Due to the rarity and excellent condition of our cars, we have to apply a damage excess for when members are driving our cars. </p>

<p>The GT100 Club will not charge your card in advance for the excess amount. </p>
<p>We will only claim the excess in the event of damage or an accident. </p>
<p>If damage repair is less than the excess level, then you will only pay the amount of the repair. </p>

<p><strong><u>Mileage allowances and excesses</strong></u></p>
<p>To help protect the cars and to help keep them in top condition, The GT100 Club also has to apply a daily mileage allowance for each car. </p>

<p>To keep this as clear as possible we split these limits into only 2 categories. We also apply a mileage excess for when members exceed their daily allowance. </p>

<p>The member agrees to the following mileage allowances and mileage excesses: </p>

<p>Cars 199 points or under have an allowance of 150 miles per day and an excess per mile of £1.00</p>

<p>Cars 200 points and over have an allowance of 125 miles per day and an excess per mile of £2.00</p>
 
<p><strong><u>The GT100 Club promises to our members</strong></u></p>

<p>Assign the agreed number of points to each members Club account. </p>

<p>Ensure all member’s club point’s accounts are managed correctly and that updated statements are provided to the members. </p>

<p>Give our members access to drive a growing collection of cars, subject to availability. </p>

<p>Ensure the cars are maintained to the highest possible standards at all times. </p>

<p>Ensure each car is checked and cleaned prior to being driven by our members. </p>

<p>Operate a Bookings System. </p>

<p>Arrange valid insurance cover at all times for the Members for the Club Cars; and ensure that the Club Cars are at all times properly taxed and retain a valid MOT certificate. </p>

<p>Provide a breakdown recovery service. </p>

<p>In the event of car breakdown or failure, ensure our members experience the minimum level of inconvenience. </p>

<p>In the event of car breakdown or failure, do our upmost to repair the car roadside or to arrange for our members to collect another car. If the member didn’t want another car for the day then we will credit back 1 days hire to their account. </p>

<p>Ensure that in the event of increasing the points of any car/s, our members will not be affected during their current annual membership and that any point’s increases would only be implemented on membership renewals. </p>

<p>Keep all members records, ID and personal details on a safe and secure server accessed only by The GT100 club personnel. </p>

<p>Bring our members additional cars during their membership. The GT100 Club will poll its members to get input into the types of cars the club should add. </p>
